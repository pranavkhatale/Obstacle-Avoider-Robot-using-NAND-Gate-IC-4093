# Obstacle-Avoider-Robot-using-NAND-Gate-IC-4093
The robot has been developed and programmed by IC 4093 control. Designed to move independently and avoid obstacles by either moving left, right or backward. Then the robot will move forward by using infrared sensors to adjust their moving. Obstacles avoid-er programmer use Otto 4 legs which rely upon two infrared emitters &amp; a receiver to sense obstacles in its environment then the programmed will order to avoid the obstacle by either stop, moving backward, or change direction to move forward. First and foremost the two sensors are connected at the front of the robot to sense the obstacle. The sensor consists of an IR led and IR sensor pair, the light transmitted from the led is reflected from the obstacle which comes in front of the robot.
